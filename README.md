# 🐝 Beeline (In Progress)

**Beeline** is a smarter way to connect people at bus stops with transit vehicles in real time. When a user taps a button in the Beeline app, their location is sent to the system’s navigation engine, which uses AI to find the most efficient route—potentially rerouting a vehicle to them directly via the fastest path.

---

## 📲 What It Does

- Riders press an **"I'm Here"** button at a bus stop using the Beeline app.
- The app sends their location to the transit navigation system.
- The system uses AI to analyze traffic, vehicle positions, and rider demand.
- If it makes sense, Beeline will reroute the closest bus to take a **direct (beeline)** path to the rider—reducing wait time and improving efficiency.
